[{"title":"Welcome!","date":"17/4/2025","tags":["welcome","first"],"author":"acskii","id":1744893487484,"content":"**Hey there curious traveler!** \r\nThis is the first blog post that will be uploaded on my personal blog website.\r\n\r\nNow I know you might be wondering, what does this mean _to you?_ \r\n\r\nLet me clarify, this website has been built mostly for my sake...\r\n\r\nI am planning to contain all the resources that I deem useful or _potentially_ helpful in an organized manner. Hopefully, the future me will thank my infinite wisdom!!\r\n\r\nAnyway, as of now, the sole content I will be mainly uploading are related to **Data Structures and Algorithms**, curated by [NeetCode.io][1].\r\n\r\nProbably a string of posts, each detailing explanation resources, personal understanding and written code.\r\n\r\nNow for some seemingly obvious information: **how to use this site?**\r\n\r\n## Navigation\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there at the top of this page is the **navigation bar**. It contains a current total of **4** buttons:\r\n- Home page button,\r\n- Posts page button,\r\n- About page button,\r\n- Dark/light mode button.\r\n> **Notice**: As of 17/4/2025, the **About** is currently under construction.\r\n\r\nOf course you came here from the Home page.\r\n\r\nYou are currently on the Posts page (obviously), clicking on the leftmost title will redirect you to my [**GitHub**][2] page, as also the rightmost bottom logo in the footer.\r\n\r\nThe Theme button on the top right of the screen, will alternate between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**. Choose freely.\r\n\r\n## Posts\r\n\r\nEach post contains information about:\r\n- Author (mostly me),\r\n- Post Title,\r\n- Upload/Update dates,\r\n- *Tags*\r\n\r\n**Tags** are a sole way to categorize the posts, which should help in locating a specific post that you may want to come back to.\r\nUse the search field to type the specific tag, and **click on the search icon**.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete tag will **not** yield results expected.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am certain that the website interface is working properly on computes/laptop devices, on mobile phones however, there seems to be an issue in UI sizes. \r\nObviously this will be fixed and this inconvenience will be resolved.\r\n\r\nAlso, the posts content **only** currently supports **dark mode**, I will look into fixing this as well. \r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n[GitHub][2] // [Email][3]\r\n\r\nWelcome to my stash, young wanderer! :)\r\nNow off you go..\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.neetcode.io\r\n[2]: https://www.github.com/acskii\r\n[3]: mailto:andrew.sameh.adel@gmail.com"}]
