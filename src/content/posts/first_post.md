**Hey there curious traveler!** 
This is the first blog post that will be uploaded on my personal blog website.

Now I know you might be wondering, what does this mean _to you?_ 

Let me clarify, this website has been built mostly for my sake...

I am planning to contain all the resources that I deem useful or _potentially_ helpful in an organized manner. Hopefully, the future me will thank my infinite wisdom!!

Anyway, as of now, the sole content I will be mainly uploading are related to **Data Structures and Algorithms**, curated by [NeetCode.io][1].

Probably a string of posts, each detailing explanation resources, personal understanding and written code.

Now for some seemingly obvious information: **how to use this site?**

## Navigation

As you can see, there at the top of this page is the **navigation bar**. It contains a current total of **4** buttons:
- Home page button,
- Posts page button,
- About page button,
- Dark/light mode button.
> **Notice**: As of 17/4/2025, the **About** is currently under construction.

Of course you came here from the Home page.

You are currently on the Posts page (obviously), clicking on the leftmost title will redirect you to my [**GitHub**][2] page, as also the rightmost bottom logo in the footer.

The Theme button on the top right of the screen, will alternate between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**. Choose freely.

## Posts

Each post contains information about:
- Author (mostly me),
- Post Title,
- Upload/Update dates,
- *Tags*

**Tags** are a sole way to categorize the posts, which should help in locating a specific post that you may want to come back to.
Use the search field to type the specific tag, and **click on the search icon**.

An incomplete tag will **not** yield results expected.

## Issues

Currently, I am certain that the website interface is working properly on computes/laptop devices, on mobile phones however, there seems to be an issue in UI sizes. 
Obviously this will be fixed and this inconvenience will be resolved.

Also, the posts content **only** currently supports **dark mode**, I will look into fixing this as well.
